<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">I have a question about my results. How can I get in touch?</li>
 <li class="an">We run a mailing list at
   <a href="http://mailman.ICSI.Berkeley.EDU/mailman/listinfo/netalyzr">http://mailman.ICSI.Berkeley.EDU/mailman/listinfo/netalyzr</a>.
   To contact us privately, please send email to <a href="mailto:netalyzr-help@icsi.berkeley.edu">netalyzr-help@icsi.berkeley.edu</a>.
   If you have a question about a particular session, please include
   the session ID. It is shown in the status bar during the analysis,
   and stated explicitly as the session's permalink at the top of the
   summary page. You can also just cut-and-paste the URL shown by your
   browser for the summary page.
   
 </li>
</ul>

<a name="info"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">What information do you collect?</li>
 <li class="an">We collect effectively the same information we present
   to you in the summary page, and nothing else. All of this
   information is collected from network connections the applet
   initiates itself.
 </li>
</ul>

<a name="nolaunch"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">There is no launch link on the start page. Why?</li>	  
 <li class="an">Your system needs to provide a Java Runtime
   Environment (JRE) for applets to operate in. Please ensure that
   a JRE is installed on your machine, and that Java is enabled in
   your browser. You can test your installation by visiting Sun's
   <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&amp;try=1">Java
   detector</a>.
</ul>

<a name="java"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">Why Java?</li>	  
 <li class="an">We are unable to perform all of the tests we provide
   using more lightweight alternatives, such as JavaScript.  In
   particular, JavaScript does not enable the browser to create
   arbitrary network connections.</li>
</ul>

<a name="java_install"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">How do I install Java?</li>	  
 <li class="an">
First make sure your browser is willing to use Java and then reload the front page:
<BR>In Internet Explorer 7, go to Tools <img src="/arr_right.gif" alt="->">
Internet Options <img src="/arr_right.gif" alt="->">
Programs <img src="/arr_right.gif" alt="->"> Manage add-ons and ensure
that the Java plugins are enabled.
<BR>In Firefox, make sure the "Enable Java" tick box under
Preferences <img src="/arr_right.gif" alt="->"> Content is selected.
<BR>In Safari, make sure the "Enable Java" tick box under
Preferences <img src="/arr_right.gif" alt="->"> Security is selected.
<BR>If that still doesn't work, follow the instructions at
at <A HREF="http://www.java.com/getjava/">http://www.java.com/getjava/</A> to download and install Java.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="java"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">Why JavaScript?</li>	  
 <li class="an">Some information, such as cookies or framing, can't be
 detected within Java but can be detected by JavaScript.  Thus in
 addition to the Java applet, there is a small amount of JavaScript on
 our analysis page to perform these checks.
 </li>
</ul>

<a name="privacy"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">Are you accessing any information on my computer?</li>	  
 <li class="an">
We do not touch any files on your disk. The only system-local
information we use is your local time, what IP address Java
believes has been assigned to your machine, and what information
your browser routinely exposes (its "user agent" and cookies
it automatically provides because you have visited our sites
before).  All other information is obtained from the network.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="probing"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">Are you probing my local network?</li>	  
 <li class="an">No. All network connectivity is exclusively with your
   DNS resolver, our servers, and any proxies in front of them.</li>
</ul>

<a name="permissions"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">The results state the applet was not permitted to
   conduct all tests. How can I allow the tests?</li>
 <li class="an">The applet operates within the confines of the
   security policy enforced by your Java runtime. When the applet
   attempts to perform an operation that violates this policy, a
   security exception is thrown, and the operation is not
   executed. Browsers handle these security restrictions in a variety
   of ways. By confirming that you trust the applet, many browsers
   will allow the applet to conduct all tests.  However, some Java
   installations will not allow certain tests to run, even if the user
   gives consent.  If you are asked to confirm individual operations,
   we suggest to permit them as required to complete the tests.
 </li>
</ul>

<a name="eicar"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">My anti-virus program triggered an alert while Netalyzr was running.
  Why?</li>  
 <li class="an">
  As part of our content-filtering tests, we download the <a href="http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm">EICAR</a>
  antivirus test file into the applet. This file is harmless and
  designed to test correct functionality of antivirus software. Any
  related warnings or alerts thus merely signal correct functioning of
  your antivirus installation and can safely be ignored.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="buffer"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">Netalyzr reports large buffers in my up/downlink. How can I fix that?</li>
 <li class="an">
The first option is just to be aware of the issue.  If you don't try
to perform large file transfers or P2P applications while also
websurfing, gaming, or using VoIP, you shouldn't notice a problem.
Buffer sizing is only a problem if you try to perform both large
transfers and interactive applications simultaneously.
<BR>The second is to pay for a higher bandwidth service, if it is
important for you to be able to perform both large file transfers and
interactive applications at the same time.  The problem is due to the
ratio between the buffer's capacity and the bandwidth of the
connection, so if you pay for more bandwidth, the buffering problem is
reduced.
<BR>Unfortunately the real solution, namely access devices which allow
programmable buffer sizing or dynamically resize their buffer based on
available bandwidth, is not generally available to the customer at
this time.

<a name="icsi"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">Who developed Netalyzr?</li>
 <li class="an">
   Netalyzr is developed by the Networking Group at
   the <A HREF="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/">International Computer
   Science Institute</A>, an independent non-profit research institute
   affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, USA.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="links"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">Are there other projects like Netalyzr?</li>
 <li class="an">
   Yes, we list some of them on our <a href="/links.html">links page</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="safer"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">What's the connection between the name <em>Netalyzr</em> and <A HREF="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/home/index.html">Safer Networking</A>?</li>
 <li class="an">
Our Netalyzr is unrelated to any of Safer Networking's products.
However, Safer Networking holds a <b>trademark</b> on the name
<A HREF="http://forums.spybot.info/forumdisplay.php?f=7">NetAlyzer</A>.
We chose the name for our tool before we had learned of this conflict.
Safer Networking has graciously agreed to allow us to continue using
the name.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="funding"></a>
<ul class="faq">
 <li class="qu">Who funded this work?</li>
 <li class="an">We gratefully acknowledge the National Science
     Foundation's financial support for this project.
</li>
</ul>
