<p class="txt-title">Netalyzr's test summary</p>
<hr class="summary">

<p>Here is some advice to help you make the most of Netalyzr's summary
page.  For background information on the tests, please visit the
Netalyzr help site over at
the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18953-understanding-your-netalyzr-results.html">New
Scientist</a>, which we formulated together in order to provide
context for less technical users.</p>

<p><b>Results are grouped in test categories.</b>  The summary is
structured into separate sections that correspond to broad categories
of tests, such as address-based ones or service reachabilities. Within
each category, individual tests are presented in a sequence of rows,
each summarizing a test result verbally.  Any noteworthy events are
summarized in an initial section at the top of the page.</p>

<p><b>Colors show result severity.</b>  To convey test outcomes
visually, each test result shows a color bar on its left that
indicates whether the test was successful (green), moderately
concerning (yellow), or identified an anomaly you should clearly know
about (red).</p>

<p><b>Click "?" for test explanations.</b>  To help you better
understand Netalyzr's tests, you can click on the small question marks
shown in each test's summary to bring up a separate window that
explains the test in more depth.  We strive to balance basic concepts
and technical detail to be helpful for all audiences.</p>

<p><b>Click "+"/"&ndash;" to expand/collapse content.</b>  At the top
of the summary as well as next to the title of each test category, a
clickable "+" and "&ndash;" allow you to expand the results to show
more detail and collapse results to hide detail, respectively.  The
buttons at the top of the summary let you expand/collapse all material
in one click.  Test results rendered in yellow or red are expanded by
default when the landing page is shown.  When collapsed, test
categories show a color bar combining green, yellow, and red in
proportion to the category's test outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Leave some feedback.</b>  We encourage you to leave feedback on
your session using the form at the bottom of the summary.  It allows
you to provide comments on the session and indicate aspects we cannot
monitor immediately, such as whether you are connected wirelessly to
the network.  All fields in the form are optional, so anonymous
feedback is welcome too.</p>
