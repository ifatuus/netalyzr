<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> Network bandwidth is the amount of data
your link is capable of sending (the uplink) or receiving (the
downlink), measured in bits per second.  The more bandwidth you have,
the faster you can transfer large files.  Likewise, more bandwidth can
allow for higher quality when streaming videos.

<P>Our estimate of this represents a <i>minimum</i>: we first try to
send and then receive a large amount of traffic, using UDP rather than
TCP.  But we do somewhat limit how much UDP traffic we send, so we will
only measure up to this limit.  It can also be limited by how many users
are currently accessing our server.
</P>

<P>Also note that this measurement can vary widely depending on
conditions.  If there is congestion in other parts of the network, or
if your ISP uses some prioritization techniques, the number reported
can vary significantly based on time of day or other usage.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> The test should first
be repeated at a different time, to make sure it isn't a transient
situation.  If the bandwidth is still unacceptably low on retesting,
you should contact your ISP about different service options.
