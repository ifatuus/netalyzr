<p><B>About this test:</B> When your web browser requests data from a
server, it sends a large number of headers which identify both the
browser and what type of information it is willing to accept.  These
indicate not only which web browser you are using but other
information about your computer as well.</P>

<P>Every site you visit receives a copy of this information, which
usually just ends up in some otherwise ignored log.  For Netalyzr,
however, we present to you what your browser sends to us, so you can
observe what information your browser chooses to transmit to all web
sites that you visit.
