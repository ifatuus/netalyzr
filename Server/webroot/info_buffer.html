<p><B>About this test:</B> In addition
to <A HREF="./info_latency.html">latency</A>
and <A HREF="./info_bandwidth">bandwidth</A>, one final, often
overlooked aspect of network quality is the amount of buffering.</P>

<P>Often, your computer wants to send or receive data faster than some
point in the network allows.  Thus that point needs a buffer to store
this data until it is able to send it.  The problem arises when the
buffer is too large or too small.  If the buffer is too small, network
protocols such
as <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</A>
are unable to send as fast as the network allows.  If the buffer is
too large, a single transfer will fill up the buffer, delaying all
other traffic.</P>

<P>Currently, a lot of users have networks which are significantly
over-buffered.  As a result, if the network is running at capacity,
packets may be substantially delayed.  This is why, for example,
BitTorrent may slow down a user's web surfing, even though TCP is able
to share all the bandwidth, the file transfer fills up the buffer
which now slows down all other traffic.</P>

<P>This test is deliberately simple.  During the latency test,
Netalyzr sends a large number of small messages between your computer
and our server and measure the time it takes for each packet to make
the trip.</P>  

<P>Then, during the bandwidth tests, these messages are significantly
larger and sent significantly faster, in an attempt to fill any
buffers in the path.  The applet now measures the time it takes for
each message to go between the applet and server when the buffers are
(hopefully) full, to gauge the maximum impact that full buffers would
have on normal traffic.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> A problem in this test
means your network can't "Walk and chew gum" at the same time.  You
can conduct large file transfers (such as using file sharing
programs), or you can perform interactive tasks (like websurfing or
VoIP calls) without the buffer being a problem.</P>  

<P>The problem occurs if you try to do both <I>types</I> of activity
at the same time: if you try to run file transfers concurrent with
other activity, the other activity will feel very "slow", as the file
transfer fills up the large buffer, adding latency to all other
traffic.</P>
