<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> Packet loss, where a message is sent but
not received, occurs continuously in the network.  Normally, this is
not a problem if the loss rate is low.  But what often occurs,
especially with wireless network, is bursts of loss: the network seems
good, but drops in and out.</P>

<P>This test is run in the background during the applet's execution,
continuously monitoring the state of the network and recording when
packets do not arrive, to check for such problems.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If you are on a
wireless network, the most likely cause is random interference and
noise.  If you move closer to the base station you will probably
experience better connectivity.  If you are on a wired network, this
may be a problem with your connection to the Internet and you should
contact your ISP for assistance.</P>
