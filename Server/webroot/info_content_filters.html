<p><B>About this test:</B> Several types of files downloadable via HTTP
tend to trigger security or copyright concerns, and may thus be
blocked. In this set of tests, we download safe and legitimate
instances of and watch for modifications to the content or outright
blocking of the content.</p>

<p>In particular, we attempt to download an MP3 file which speaks
"netalyzr", a BitTorrent file for a Linux distribution, a benign
Windows executable, and a standard
<a href="http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm">test file</a>
to check for the proper operation of any network anti-virus
software.</p>

<p>All of these files are merely downloaded into the applet and
neither stored nor executed on your machine.  If you received a notice
from your antivirus software, it was detecting the standard test
file.</p>
