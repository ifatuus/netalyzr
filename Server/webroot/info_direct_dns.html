<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer
contacts a Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer
controlled by your ISP which acts as an intermediary.</p>

<p>It is often desirable for computers to be able to query specific
DNS servers on the Internet directly, instead of relying on the
default server assigned to your network.  Such queries may be blocked
by firewalls or NATs which disallow the use of arbitrary DNS resolver,
or which attempt to proxy DNS traffic while not fully supporting the
DNS protocol.</P>

<P>In this test, your computer conducts a series of direct DNS queries
to our own DNS server to determine if some of these specialized queries are
disrupted by the network.  Since all these queries conform to the DNS
protocol, any blockage indicates either a deliberate restriction on
DNS or, more likely, a network device that attempts to understand DNS
traffic without fully implementing the DNS protocol.
</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> The most likely cause
if some DNS requests are allowed but these specialized requests are
blocked is an error in your firewall or NAT.  Thankfully it is
reasonably unlikely that your Internet experience is affected greatly
by such broken devices. If you are on a public network there is not
much you can do.  On your home network, try updating your NAT to the
latest firmware.  If you are on a corporate network, the responsible
devices should probably be updated.
