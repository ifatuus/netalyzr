<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer contacts a
Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer controlled by
your ISP which acts as an intermediary.  Recently, a series of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning">cache
poisoning attacks</a> on the DNS system were discovered that can be
thwarted in a number of ways.</p>

<p>One such defense
is <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1455770.1455798">0x20
randomization</a>.  In this scheme, the DNS resolver randomly changes
the capitalization of names and ensures that returned names match the
chosen capitalization.  This test queries a special name we control
which detects the presence of any 0x20 randomization employed by your
ISP's DNS resolver.
