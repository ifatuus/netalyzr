<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer
contacts a Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer
controlled by your ISP which acts as an intermediary.<p>

<P>One portion of how DNS resolvers operate is "glue".  When your
ISP's resolver asks for a name like "@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@", the
response can include a bunch of additional records, which are commonly
known as glue.  An important question is whether your ISP's DNS
resolver accepts such records and will return them in subsequent
queries, a process known as "glue acceptance" or "bailiwick checking".</p>

<P>One special set of such records are "authoritative" records,
indicating which nameservers are responsible for a domain.  This test
works by querying special names in a domain we control, where we
return some authoritative nameserver records, and then we check if
subsequent queries will return the additional record supplied or an
unrelated record.</p>
