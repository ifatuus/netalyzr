<span class="txt-summary">DNS CNAMEs</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer
contacts a Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer
controlled by your ISP which acts as an intermediary.</p>

<P>One portion of how DNS resolvers operate is how they respond to
CNAMEs.  When your ISP's resolver asks for a name like
"www.google.com", the response can include a CNAME saying
"www.google.com is really www.l.google.com".  Additionally, the
response can, at the same time, include a record for the alias,
giving the address for "www.l.google.com".</p>

<P>An important but subtle portion of DNS operations is how your ISP's
DNS resolver accepts these fields, as part of the "glue acceptance" or
"bailiwick checking" policy.</P>

<P>This test works by querying special names in a domain we control,
where the response is different depending on whether the additional
data for the CNAME is accepted or not.  Thus we can deduce how the DNS
resolver handles CNAMEs.</p>
