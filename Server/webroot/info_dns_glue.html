<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer
contacts a Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer
controlled by your ISP which acts as an intermediary.</p>

<P>One aspect affecting DNS resolver operation is their treatment of
"glue".  When your ISP's resolver asks for a name, the response may
include several additional records besides the actual answer.  These
records are commonly known as "glue".  An important question is
whether your ISP's DNS resolver accepts such records and will return
them in subsequent queries, a process known as "glue acceptance" or
"bailiwick checking".</p>

<P>This test works by querying special names in a domain we control.
Our DNS server answers these with additional glue records.  We then
check your resolver's treatment of these records using subsequent
queries: if these return the additional records we supplied, your
resolver accepts external glue records.</p>
