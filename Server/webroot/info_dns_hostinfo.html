<span class="txt-summary">DNS-based host information</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> Various organizations on the Internet provide information about
hosts based on the host's IP addresses.  These services operate by
using DNS (the Domain Name System) to conduct the query.  In this
test, we query some of these services for your computer's status. In
particular, we test the following:
<ul>
<li>Whether you are an exit node for
the <a href="http://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> overlay network.</li>
<li>Whether you are listed on spam/malware-related blacklists. We are
testing the ones operated by <a href="">Spamhaus</a>.</li>
<li>Whether your IP address seems to be assigned statically or
dynamically.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If you are on a public
network (such as a WiFi hotspot), the Spamhaus blacklists may include
your current public IP address because of behavior exhibited by
another user's machine previously using the same address.  A similar
problem affects networks that obtain their public IP address
dynamically, as ISPs may issue the IP same addresses to different
customers over time.  If you get this alert on your home or business
connection, you should make sure your antivirus software is up to
date.
