<span class="txt-summary">DNS lookup performance</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In this test we measure the latency of DNS lookups performed by the
resolver configured on your machine. This latency directly affects the
performance you observer in application using the network.  If the
figure is too high (generally over 300-500ms), you may perceive the
network as being "slow" even when your traffic is able to download
quickly.</p>

<p>We measure this latency in two ways: the time required for uncached
lookups informs you about the minimum time taken for lookups the
resolver cannot immediately answer itself but must instead query our
server, while the time required for cached lookups is a lower bound
for all DNS lookups using this resolver.</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If this test reports a
problem but your normal network latency is acceptable, the first step
would be to try again in an hour or two to determine if this is just a
transient problem.  If the performance is still unacceptable, you may
wish to shift to a third-party DNS resolver or contact your ISP for
assistance.
