<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such
as "@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer contacts a
Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  However, DNS resolvers can also
be used for "DOS amplification attacks", where an attacker creates
fake requests which generate a large amount of traffic in reply,
flooding a victim's network connection.</P>

<P>This test checks to make sure you are not inadvertently running an
externally accessible DNS resolver or proxy which others could
exploit.  The test works by sending a small request to your IP address
to see if its affected by this problem.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> The most likely cause
is a bad NAT/"home router", which does not simply act as an internal
DNS proxy but also accepts external requests due to a bug.  You should
make sure your NAT is fully up to date.  If this error persists after
updating your NAT, you should contact your NAT vendor to report this
as a bug.</P>
