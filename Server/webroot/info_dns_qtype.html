<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer
contacts a Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer
controlled by your ISP which acts as an intermediary.</p>

<P>One subtle question is how DNS resolvers ask for this information.
Most ask for an "A" record (QTYPE=A).  But a few ask for "ANY" records
about a host (QTYPE=ANY). </p>

<P>This test works by querying special names in a domain we control,
where the result differs based on whether it was queried for an A
record or an ANY record.</P>
