<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer contacts a
Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer controlled by
your ISP which acts as an intermediary.  Recently, a series of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning">cache
poisoning attacks</a> on the DNS system were discovered that can be
thwarted in a number of ways.</p>

<p>One such defense is DNS port randomization.  If your ISP's DNS
resolver does not implement port randomization, you and all other
users of this resolver are potentially vulnerable to DNS cache
poisoning, where an attacker can cause any name to resolve to a system
they control, allowing them to intercept and modify effectively all
network traffic!</p>

<p>In this test we check whether your ISP's DNS resolver employs port
randomization to protect you from cache poisoning attacks.</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> Lacking port
randomization is both a very serious and now nearly two year old
problem.  You should contact your network provider or consider using a
third-party DNS service provider such
as <A HREF="http://www.opendns.com">Open DNS</A>
or <A HREF="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.html">Google
Public DNS</A>.
