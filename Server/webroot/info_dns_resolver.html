<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such
as "@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer contacts a
Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer usually
controlled by your ISP which acts as an intermediary.  This test
attempts to determine your DNS resolver's identity.</p>
