<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer contacts a
Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer controlled by
your ISP which acts as an intermediary.</P>

<P>In this series of tests, we examine various properties of how your
DNS resolver conducts requests.</P>

<P><B>DNS resolver latency:</B> This tests measures how quickly your
DNS resolver is able to return a name.  Slow resolvers may make the
net seem "slow" even if the network itself is fast.
</P>

<P><B>DNS record type:</B> Some DNS resolvers use "A records" (host
record) requests to find hosts, while some others ask for "ANY
records".  This test determines which convention your ISP's resolver
uses.
</P>

<P><B>DNS support for IPv6:</B> IPv6 is the next generation Internet
protocol.  This test records whether your DNS resolver is asking for
IPv6 addresses as well as IPv4 addresses.
</P>

<P><B>EDNS and DNSSEC:</B> Extended DNS (EDNS) is an optional
mechanism in DNS, commonly used for DNS Security (DNSSEC).  This test
records whether the resolver will request DNSSEC records and use EDNS
to accept larger results.
</P>

<P><B>0x20 Randomization:</B> 0x20 randomization uses random
CaPiTALizaTion to encode a random value in a DNS request.  This test
records whether your resolver uses 0x20, and, if not, will it pass
requests in a case-sensitive manner.
</P>

<P><B>Short TTLs:</B> DNS records have a Time to Live (TTL) field
measured in seconds.  This test verifies that your DNS resolver
properly handles short TTLs.</A>
</P>
