<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to test how your ISP's DNS resolver, the component which
translates a mnemonic name such as "@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@" into an Internet
address, the applet needs to be able to perform DNS queries.

<P>Java does not always allow arbitrary lookups of names, depending on
the security settings.  This test determines whether the applet can
look up an unrelated name which nonetheless resolves to the server's
address.  If successful, we are then able to look up special names to
determine information on how your DNS resolver handles "glue" records
and other requests.
