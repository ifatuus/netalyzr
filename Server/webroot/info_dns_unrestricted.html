<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to test how your ISP's DNS resolver, the component which
translates a mnemonic name such as "@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@" into an Internet
address, the applet needs to be able to perform DNS queries.

<P>Java does not always allow arbitrary lookups of names, depending on
the security settings.  This test determines whether the applet can
look up a name which does not resolve to this server's address.  If
successful, this means the applet can perform all the DNS tests.
