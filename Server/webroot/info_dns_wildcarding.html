<span class="txt-summary">DNS wildcarding</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> The DNS system is responsible for turning
mnemonic names into Internet addresses.  But what if the name does not
exist, either because of a typo or other failure?  In such case, the
server is supposed to return a failure, which will tell the program
that "this name currently does not exist".

<P>Recently, however, several ISPs have started wildcarding these
errors on their DNS servers by doing NXDOMAIN rewriting, thus instead
of returning "no such name", they return the address of a server which
suggests corrections as a way of generating profit for the ISP by
serving advertisements.

<P>Such behavior, although it attempts to be helpful, can cause other
problems.  For example, the web browser itself may have correction
mechanisms which will be blocked by this.  An example is where
Firefox, if you type in a single word, will first attempt a DNS
lookup, and, if it fails, perform a Google search.  DNS NXDOMAIN
rewriting will disrupt this functionality.</P>

<P>Similarly, web browsers are not the only application which performs
DNS lookups, and which expect a failure when a name does not exist.
This problem is exacerbated if the ISP also blocks access to
third-party DNS resolvers.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> Try typing a random
address in your web browser, one composed of a large number of
characters produced by just pounding on the keyboard.  This will
usually cause the ISP's advertisement page to appear, which should
contain opt-out instructions to disable this feature.  If there are no
opt-out instructions, or if the opt-out instructions are unclear, we
would suggest calling your ISP's customer service to complain about
the lack of a clear and usable opt-out.
</P>
