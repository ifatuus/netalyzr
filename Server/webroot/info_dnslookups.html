<span class="txt-summary">DNS lookups for popular domains</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, your computer
contacts a Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer
controlled by your ISP which acts as an intermediary.</p>

<p>The DNS servers can also answer reverse lookups, translating the IP address
to a mnemonic name. Testing whether a reverse lookup succeeds and
whether the name obtained in the reverse lookup matches the original
name is an important security mechanism, since it provides a degree of
assurance that the translation to an IP address was performed
correctly.  Attackers are often interested in changing DNS
information, so that your computer is misdirected.</p>

<p>In this test, your computer looks up the IP addresses of a number
of popular domains, and our server performs the corresponding reverse
lookups, and checks for consistency.  Unfortunately, not all domains
support reverse lookups, so sometimes we are unable to find an
answer.</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> The most common cause is
a false positive due to <A HREF="info_dns_wildcarding.html">DNS
Wildcarding</A> combined with a transient error or incomplete
information on our part as to what the proper reverse names may be for
the hostname in question.</P>

<P>However, there may be other causes.  For example, some ISPs will
impersonate www.google.com, resolving it to the address of a local
proxy instead of a Google server.  There also exists malware which
changes victims' DNS settings to employ malicious resolvers.  One
strand of such malware will cause windowsupdate.microsoft.com to
resolve to a Google IP address, or ad.doubleclick.net to resolve
anomalously.  If our tests indicate such problems, you should update
your antivirus software and remove any manual DNS settings on your
computer or your NAT.
</P>
