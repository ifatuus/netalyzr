<p><B>About this test:</B> In order to translate a mnemonic name (such
as "@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an IP address, this involves a protocol
knows as DNS, or the Domain Name Service.  EDNS, or Extended DNS, is
an extension to the DNS protocol necessary to implement DNS security
enhancements, which require the ability to send significantly longer
messages.  Unfortunately, some older network devices do not understand
EDNS and think it is anomalous.</P>

</P>This test works by sending DNS messages from the applet to our
server, which then replies with EDNS responses of varying size.  The
small reply is to check that EDNS is supported, while the medium and
large reply are used to check whether a network device rejects large
DNS replies, which will be necessary as DNS information becomes
cryptographically signed.</P>

<p><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If the UDP
fragmentation test doesn't work, that is the most likely cause of any
failure on this test.  If that test works fine, the most likely
cause is a misconfiguration or error in your NAT ("home router") or
firewall.  You should make sure your home router or firewall
is running updated software to prevent what might be perceived as
mysterious failures and slowdowns when DNSSEC becomes more widely
deployed.</P>
