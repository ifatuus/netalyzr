<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> HTTP proxies are a core component of the
architecture of the World Wide Web. HTTP proxies are able to cache
content locally, thus speeding up web content retrieval times for your
browser. Unfortunately, misconfiguration proxies can cause your
browser to render outdated content. In the worst case malicious
proxies can modify the content of your web pages. It is therefore
important to be aware of any proxies that process your HTTP
traffic.</p>

<p>Often, the purpose of proxies is to <i>cache</i> data, to store it
to speed subsequent requests by you and other users.  Our server has
the ability to return a piece of data which changes with each request,
but which would appear to a proxy to be cacheable or uncacheable.
Thus this test detects if an HTTP cache exists and, if it does,
whether it is operating correctly or caching data that it should
not.</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> Caches are usually
acceptable as long as the user is aware of them and they work
correctly.  If, however, our tests indicate overzealous caching
behavior (such as when data we marked "uncacheable" is nevertheless
cached), you should complain to your network provider, as this
indicates a serious problem with the cache.</P>
