<span class="txt-summary">HTTP proxy detection through IP addresses</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> HTTP proxies are a core component of the architecture of the World
Wide Web. HTTP proxies are able to cache content locally, thus
speeding up web content retrieval times for your
browser. Unfortunately, misconfigured proxies can cause your browser
to render outdated content. In the worst case malicious proxies can
modify the content of your web pages. It is therefore important to be
aware of any proxies that process your HTTP traffic.</p>

<p>HTTP traffic flowing through HTTP proxies that do not operate
transparently may appear to be arriving at our server from different
IP addresses than your regular traffic. By examining the source IP
addresses, this test attempts to identify such proxies and reports the
results.</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> The presence of a proxy
is unlikely to be an error, but it is something that you should be
aware of.  If you are concerned about the role of the proxy, you
should contact your network operator to learn what function this proxy
performs.</P>
