<span class="txt-summary">HTTP proxy detection through HTTP headers</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> HTTP proxies are a core component of the
architecture of the World Wide Web. HTTP proxies are able to cache
content locally, thus speeding up web content retrieval times for your
browser.  Another common use is enforcing local policies, such as on a
corporate network.
Unfortunately, misconfigured proxies can cause your browser
to render outdated content. In the worst case malicious proxies can
modify the content of your web pages. It is therefore important to be
aware of any proxies that process your HTTP traffic.</p>

<p>Well-behaved proxies report their presence through headers such as
"Via" and "X-Cache-Lookup".  Other proxies do not directly report
their presence, but may introduce measurable changes in the HTTP
connection.  This test examines the headers of HTTP responses and
changes in the HTTP traffic for signs of proxy presence and reports
the findings.</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> The presence of a proxy
is unlikely to be an error, but it is something that you should be
aware of.  If you are concerned about the role of the proxy, you
should contact your network operator to learn what function this proxy
performs.</P>
