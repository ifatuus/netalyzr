<span class="txt-summary">HTTP proxy detection through malformed requests</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> HTTP proxies are a core component of the
architecture of the World Wide Web. HTTP proxies are able to cache
content locally, thus speeding up web content retrieval times for your
browser. Unfortunately, misconfigured proxies can cause your browser
to render outdated content. In the worst case malicious proxies can
modify the content of your web pages. It is therefore important to be
aware of any proxies that process your HTTP traffic.</p>

<p>This test sends malformed HTTP requests to our server. Our server
is custom-developed to understand and serve these requests, while
regular HTTP proxies generally are not. If a malformed request does
not arrive at our server while regular ones do, this is an indication
of a proxy interposing on your HTTP traffic.</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> The presence of a proxy
is unlikely to be an error, but it is something that you should be
aware of.  If you are concerned about the role of the proxy, you
should contact your network operator to learn what function this proxy
performs.</P>
