<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> The current standard for transporting
packets on the Internet is version 4 of the Internet Protocol, called
IPv4.  Due to limitations in IPv4 that will eventually hinder the
network's growth a new Internet Protocol, IPv6, has been in
development for several years.  It alleviates many of the problems in
IPv4, and is beginning to see accelerating deployment.</P>

<P>This test determines if your computer has native IPv6
connectivity. To allow us to do this, we employ a dedicated test
server that is both IPv6 and IPv4 enabled. If the test fails, don't
worry, as to date only few people are using IPv6 from their home
networks, and practically all sites which use IPv6 also support
IPv4.</P>
