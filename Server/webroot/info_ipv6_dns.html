<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In this test we measure whether your system
supports looking up names that use IPv6 instead of, or in addition to,
IPv4.  This checks whether your system, your system's DNS server, and
their interaction with Google will support IPv6.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If this test reports a
problem it is probably related to
bad <a href="info_dns_wildcarding.html">NXDOMAIN wildcarding</a>,
which means your DNS server turns failing DNS name lookups into
alternative (typically advertisement-enhanced) "suggestions".  These
can cause problems for applications other than your web browser.</P>
