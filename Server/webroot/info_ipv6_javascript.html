<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> JavaScript is the dominant scripting
language used in the World Wide Web today. It is employed by the
majority of web sites to make content more dynamic.  The current
standard for transporting packets on the Internet is version 4 of the
Internet Protocol, called IPv4.  Due to limitations in IPv4 that will
eventually hinder the network's growth a new Internet Protocol, IPv6,
has been in development for several years.  It alleviates many of the
problems in IPv4, and is beginning to see accelerating deployment.</P>

<P>We use JavaScript to check how your web browser reacts when offered
an IPv4 address, an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, or only an IPv6 address
for a web resource.  More precisely, we test whether your browser can
download an image using each of the three alternatives, and which
protocol it prefers when given a choice.  For the downloads that
succeed, we also record the time taken.  If the timing differences are
substantial, your web experience may depend crucially on whether IPv4
or IPv6 is used for the download.</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> Please note that the
download times may be affected by a number of external factors. If
temporal differences seem substantial, try repeated sessions and if
possible experiment with different browsers.</P>
