<p><B>About this test:</B> In this suite of tests we determine basic
TCP connectivity available from your computer when using the IPv6
network protocol. The tests are otherwise similar to
the <a href="info_tcp_connectivity.html">ones conducted over IPv4</a>,
so make sure to compare the respective results.

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> This depends on the
protocol involved and the context.  In some cases, the reason is
merely technical and not a cause for concern.  For example, many NATs
will disrupt our FTP test due to the unique nature of the FTP
protocol, but this does not stop FTP from working.  Services are also
frequently blocked for policy or security reasons.  For example, many
ISPs block the common Windows ports (SMB, RPC, etc.) in order to
shield their customers from attacks, and restrict outbound SMTP reduce
the volume of spam sent from any infected clients' machines.
Corporate networks often impose a considerable amount of filtering as
part of their network usage policy.</P>
