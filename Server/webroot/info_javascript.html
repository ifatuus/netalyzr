<p><B>About this test:</B> JavaScript is the dominant scripting
language used in the World Wide Web today. It is employed by the majority
of web sites to make content more dynamic.</p>

<p>We check whether your browsers has JavaScript enabled, and if so,
use it to test whether a proxy is used to force arbitrary web pages to
run in frames, usually in order to present advertising alongside the
intended content. We also use it to verify the integrity of the
cookies that your browser sends when visiting the Netalyzr site, and to
determine your browser's support for <a href="info_ipv6_javascript">IPv6</a>.</p>

<P>You may see reports of cookies such as "__utma" or "__utmz".  These
cookies were not set by our server.  Rather, you visited a web page
somewhere else in the berkeley.edu domain that contained a Google
