<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> Network latency, the time it takes a message
to travel from your computer to a sever, has a huge impact on how
you experience the network.  For example, when you click on a link,
multiple messages pass between your system and the web server and,
until enough messages have been exchanged, the page will not begin to
appear.  Thus you generally want low latency, as this makes
your web surfing feel faster and enables better performance in online
games and VoIP (Internet Telephony) technology.</P>

<P>Latency can be affected by many things.  If the remote server is
far away, latency is higher.  If there is significant other activity
on the network, you may also experience higher latency. Some access
technologies such as satellite communication also add very high
latency.</P>

<P>This applet measures latency by sending a series of small messages
to our server and then seeing how long it takes the messages to
return.  We send 200 small UDP packets (12 bytes of payload), at
a rate of 20 packets per second.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If you are outside of
the US, your latency to our servers should naturally be higher.  Other
conditions may also affect latency, including line noise or a weak
wireless signal.  If the problem persists, you should contact your ISP
to help resolve the issue.</P>
