<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> Networks cannot transfer arbitrarily big
messages.  Their paths are limited by their Maximum Transmission Unit
(MTU), the largest message the network can transport in one piece.
For example, our entrance to the network has an MTU of 1500 bytes,
which is the standard size for Ethernet networks.  Other devices on
the Internet may restrict this size to a smaller amount.</P>

<P>This test attempts to discover the network's MTU for the path
between your system and our server when using IPv6, the
next-generation Internet Protocol standard that is seeing increasing
adoption.
For the path between your system and our server we cannot conduct a
complete probe.  Instead, we send a single, fragmented message from
the applet, to which our server replies with the length of the first
fragment. This is often, but not always, the network's MTU.</P>

<P>The path between our server and your network is probed in more
detail.  In this test, large IP datagrams are sent from the server to
the client.  If the packet would pass through a network with a smaller
MTU, the network is supposed to reply back to our server that this is
a problem, and our server forwards that on to the client.  This allows
us to search for the largest permissible packet size.  This also
detects cases where the fragmenting network does not send the proper
notification back to our server.</P>

<P>At the same time, if your network supports a large MTU, we are able
to check if such "too big" messages are correctly received by your
computer.  To accomplish this, our server, although it could accept a
large message, instead replies with a "too big" message which your
computer should then use to send the message broken into smaller
fragments.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If there is a problem,
there is unfortunately little that can be done since MTU problems can
in principle be located anywhere between your computer and our
servers.  If you experience spurious connectivity problems for long
amounts of time, you can attempt to reduce the MTU on your computer's
network interface.  If that does not help, please contact your
ISP.</P>
