<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> Home network gateways typically translate
the local IP addresses of computers on your network to a single global
IP address that is used to route your traffic across the
Internet. Such network address translation (NAT) allows you to share
Internet connectivity in your network and reduces the overall number
of routable IP addresses in use, but complicates many
applications.</p>

<p>In this test, we determine whether your machine sits behind a
NAT. We also determine aspects of how the actual translation is done;
in particular, we look at the sequencing of the TCP source ports of
subsequent connections crossing the NAT. If you are not behind a NAT,
this test instead shows how your machine allocates TCP source ports.</p>
