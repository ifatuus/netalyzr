<p><B>About this test:</B> The SMTP protocol is the standard delivery
mechanism for e-mail.  Malware frequently attempts to deliver large
amounts of spam by directly contacting SMTP servers all over the
Internet, which has caused many ISPs to block SMTP connectivity to all
but the ISP's own SMTP servers.</p>

<p>In this test, we determine whether you are able to connect to an
SMTP server not related to the ISP. If the test fails, you need to
ensure that you are using the SMTP servers permitted by your ISP, or
use other forms of e-mail, such as web-based e-mail providers.
