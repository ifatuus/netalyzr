<p><B>About this test:</B> Every computer employs a clock for many
different tasks.  Often, the clock is synchronized against a remote
and highly accurate clock using NTP, the Network Time Protocol.  Our
servers do so, too.<P>

<P>Since the applet records the time at which it is run, we are able
to compare the applet's view of time with our server's view of time,
which allows us to notify you if your clock is running overly fast or
slow.  Many activities are affected by the system clock, so it is
important to ensure that it keeps time accurately.</P>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If the clock is off by
several hours, the most likely reason is a time-zone discrepancy
rather than a problem with your clock itself.  In general, you should
ensure that your computer is set to automatically update its clock.</P>
