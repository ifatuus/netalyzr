<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In this suite of tests we determine basic
TCP connectivity available from your computer. In particular, we test
whether your machine is allowed to send the following to our server:
<ul>
<li>Manually crafted HTTP connections. We require these for a number
of HTTP-related tests.</li>
<li>SMTP connections.  This tests whether you can send email directly
to recipients.  While this may be convenient for users, it is often
restricted in order to limit spamming from infected machines.</li>
<li>TCP-based DNS requests. These provide an alternative way to
conduct DNS requests, but may be blocked.</li>
<li>Other services.  Here we test whether various common services
(such as SSH, IMAP, or POP3) are blocked.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> This depends on the
protocol involved and the context.  In some cases, the reason is
merely technical and not a cause for concern.  For example, many NATs
will disrupt our FTP test due to the unique nature of the FTP
protocol, but this does not stop FTP from working.  Services are also
frequently blocked for policy or security reasons.  For example, many
ISPs block the common Windows ports (SMB, RPC, etc.) in order to
shield their customers from attacks, and restrict outbound SMTP reduce
the volume of spam sent from any infected clients' machines.
Corporate networks often impose a considerable amount of filtering as
part of their network usage policy.</P>
