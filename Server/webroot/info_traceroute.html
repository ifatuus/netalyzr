<p><B>About this test:</B> When a message is sent from our server to
your computer it passes through a series of Internet routers.  This
test uses a technique commonly known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute"
target="_blank">"traceroute"</a> to determine both which routers the
messages pass through and how long it takes for our server to send a
message to each router and back. This path and timing information is
often useful for detailed network diagnostics and debugging&mdash;for
example, you can see which companies' networks your traffic traverses
as your computer interacts with our servers.</p>
