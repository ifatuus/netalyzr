<p><B>About this test:</B> When a message is sent from our server to
your computer it passes through a series of Internet routers.  This
test uses a technique commonly known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute"
target="_blank">"traceroute"</a> to determine both which routers the
messages pass through, and how long it takes messages to travel from
our server to each router and back.  This path and timing information
is often useful for detailed network diagnostics and
debugging&mdash;for example, you can see which companies' networks
your traffic traverses as your computer interacts with our
servers.</p>

<P>In this test, we conduct two separate traceroutes from our IPv6
test server to your system, one using IPv4 and one using IPv6. This
allows you to compare the routing behavior of the two protocols for
your system.</P>
