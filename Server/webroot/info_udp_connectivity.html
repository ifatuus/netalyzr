<span class="txt-summary">UDP connectivity</span>
<hr class="summary"/>

<p><B>About this test:</B> In this suite of tests we determine basic
UDP connectivity available from your computer. In particular, we test
whether your machine is allowed to send the following to our server:
<ul>
<li>UDP datagrams on arbitrary ports. A number of applications require
this connectivity, which may be blocked by default.</li>
<li>Correct fragmentation of large UDP datagrams. Support for
fragmented IP datagrams is important for ensuring robust operation
regardless of your <a href="info_mtu.html">network MTU</a>.</li>
<li>UDP-based DNS requests. The ability to send DNS requests to
arbitrary resolver of your choosing is important, since it allows you
to choose a different DNS service (such
as <a href="http://www.opendns.com">OpenDNS.com</a>.  On the other
hand, this freedom also implies that you are at risk of inadvertently
using an unwanted DNS resolver or can bypass controls which are part
of a commercial network.
</li>
<li>Other services, particularly UDP port 1434, once used by the
notorious SQL Slammer worm.</li>
</ul>

<P><B>What if this test reports a problem:</B> If you are using
firewalling software on your computer, make sure it does not interfere
incorrectly.  If you are unable to configure arbitrary DNS resolvers
but would like to do so, contact your ISP.  If we report a path MTU
hole, it means that a network component is unable to process IP
datagrams that are larger than its local interface MTUs.  There is
little you can do about this, but see the <a href="info_mtu.html">path
MTU</a> help page for more information.</P>
