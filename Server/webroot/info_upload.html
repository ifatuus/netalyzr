<p><B>About this test:</B> There are several cases where the applet
uploads data of interest, including unexpected response content and
web content served at IP addresses resulting from name lookups that
should have failed (see <a href="info_dns_wildcarding.html">DNS
wildcarding</a>).  In addition, the low-level HTTP tests also upload
all data received from our server.  You may inspect all uploaded
content from the summary page.</P>
