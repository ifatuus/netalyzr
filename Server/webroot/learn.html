<p>The Netalyzr analyzes various properties of your Internet
connection that you should care about &mdash; including blocking of
important services, HTTP caching behavior and proxy correctness, your
DNS server's resilience to abuse, NAT detection, as well as latency
&amp; bandwidth measurements &mdash; and reports its findings in a
detailed report.  You can check out an
<a href="http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/restore/id=example-session">example
report</a> from a real network to get a better idea of our tests.</p>

<p>To perform these tests, the Netalyzr runs a Java applet on your
computer.  You may be asked to confirm network-related activities that
your system's applet security policy or firewall considers
sensitive. We hope that you will permit any such activity, as it will
ensure more comprehensive test results. For details on the tests that
will be performed please visit the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a>
section.</p>

<p>Click the link below to launch the probe applet. If you don't see a
clickable link, you don't have Java installed, it is not enabled in
your browser, or your runtime is incompatible. In that case, see
the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a> section for help.  Users of Firefox's
"NoScript" add-on may need to reload this page and wait a few seconds
for Java to start.</p>
