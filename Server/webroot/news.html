<p><B>May 24, 2010:</B> Today we're very glad to announce
a partnership
with <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18938-revealing-the-secrets-of-the-internets-gatekeepers.html">New
Scientist</a>. Not only is New Scientist going to feature the Netalyzr
in a series of articles based on findings of our measurement study,
their site also kindly hosts a
helpful <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18953-understanding-your-netalyzr-results.html">guide
to understanding Netalyzr results</a> for people of all technical
skill levels.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we have added a <a href="/map.html">map</a> to the site,
showing locations on the globe from where people have conducted test
sessions.  Thanks for using Netalyzr!
</p>

<p><B>February 19, 2010:</B> An unnanounced power outage has knocked
the Netalyzr site offline for approximately 12 hours. Things should be
back to normal at this point. We apologize for the inconvenience.
</p>

<p><B>January 12, 2010:</B> We are out of beta!  We have been toiling
hard to implement new tests, make the existing ones more robust, and
improve the user interface.  Among the changes we are rolling out
today are:

<ul>
<li><p><span class="txt-bold">New tests.</span>  We now provide a path
MTU test, IP fragmentation analysis, DNS proxy examination, DNS
SERFVAIL wildcarding detection, more precise clock drift detection,
and check correct resolution of a lot more names.  Besides the
improved client-side transcript you can now inspect the server-side
one, which is useful for debugging highly troubled sessions. In
addition, we have improved the robustness of the existing tests in
many ways.
</p>

<li><p><span class="txt-bold">Interface improvements.</span>  A
frequent complaint we received was that the results summary is
overwhelming. As a first step to improve the situation, you can now
selectively show or hide result summary detail. On the summary page,
you find clickable plus/minus symbols that will expand/collapse test
results on the entire page, in a particular test class, or on a
particular test. When you first arrive at the summary page, any issues
we have noticed remain expanded by default.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="toggle.png" alt="Visibility toggle"></p>

<p>To give you an idea of how successful a particular set of tests was,
we now provide a color summary in collapsed results. These show
successful tests (green), mild anomalies (orange), and real problems
(red) in proportion to their occurrence in the collapsed results:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="color-summary.png" alt="Color summary"></p>
</li>

<li><p><span class="txt-bold">Updated info pages.</span>  Each of our
tests comes with an info page, available by clicking on the test's
name (such as "Path MTU" in the above).  We have given those info
pages a makeover, which will hopefully make them easier to understand
and more useful to less technical users.
</li>
</ul>
