  Embedding Netalyzr
  ==================

  You can embed Netalyzr in one of two forms: as a start link as shown
  on the Netalyzr homepage (use option m=link), or directly as the
  application that executes the testsuite (use option m=app).  In
  addition, you can theme the appearance of the iframe by adding
  suitable URL-encoded parameters. The full URL format is:

  http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/iframe/d={link|app}/m=mode/l=lang/tc=col/bc=col/lc=col/h=int/s=float//t=[yn]/w=int

  The parameters' meanings are as as follows:

  - d:  display, either "link" (default when not used) for start link, 
        or "app" for running testsuite right away.
  - m:  test mode.
  - l:  language, e.g. "en" or "de".

  The following options apply only to the start link mode (m=link):

  - tc: text color for warnings regarding JavaScript/Java enabledness.
  - bc: background color.
  - lc: text color of the "Start analysis" link.

  - w:  width of the applet, in pixles.
  - h:  height of the applet, in pixles.

  - s:  scaling of the "Start analysis" link. Try something around 1.5.
  - t:  JavaScript/Java availability tests, either "y" or "n"

  To specify a color, use the HTML/CSS format (for example #112233 or
  #abc). You do not need to include the '#' character.

  The recommended size for an iframe is a width of at least 500 pixels
  and a height of at least 70 pixels.
