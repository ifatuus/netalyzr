<p>In order to translate a mnemonic name (such as
"@NETALYZR_DOMAIN@") to an Internet address, your computer will
contact a Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver.  This is a computer
controlled by your ISP which acts as an intermediary.</p>

<P>It is critical that this system operates properly and without
errors.  Part of our tests attempt to determine the behavior of this
DNS resolver.  These tests require the Java applet to look up
arbitrary names, such as the identity of www.google.com, in order to
ensure that your ISP's resolver returns the proper values.  Since this
test succeeded, we can perform the complete suite of DNS tests.</p>
